    "A common pathfinding algorithm in computer science and artificial intelligence is the A* (A-star) algorithm. Its purpose is to determine the shortest path on a graph or grid between a starting point and a goal point. Combining the ideas of Greedy Best-First Search and Dijkstra's algorithm, A* uses a heuristic function to effectively direct the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimality: If certain requirements are satisfied, A* ensures that the shortest path will be found. \n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristic Guidance: A* estimates the cost from the current node to the goal using a heuristic function, commonly referred to as the \"h-value\". By directing the search, this heuristic increases algorithmic efficiency by examining the most promising paths first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various methods can be employed to apply the A* algorithm on a map, including the fixed-grid size approach, Voronoi diagrams, visibility graphs, and cell decomposition methods. Each method offers distinct advantages and considerations for pathfinding applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we assessed two primary pathfinding approaches: the fixed-grid size method and the visibility graph. Although the visibility graph demonstrated a slightly faster computation time, the difference was not substantial. However, a critical drawback surfaced with the visibility graph method, as it significantly reduced the number of reachable points, resulting in suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see our visibility graph below: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\vis_graph.jpeg\" alt=\"Visibility Graph\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that computation time differences were marginal, we decided to favor the fixed-grid size approach. This method involves dividing the map into uniform squares of predetermined cell sizes and utilizing obstacle masks generated through computer vision to construct a grid. The A* algorithm is then applied to this grid to determine the most efficient path.\n",
